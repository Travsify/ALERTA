Warning: Flutter support 
for your project's Kotlin 
version (2.0.0) will soon 
be dropped. Please 
upgrade your Kotlin 
version to a version of 
at least 2.1.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the 
flag "--android-skip-build
-dependency-validation" 
to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your 
project's KGP version is 
typically defined in the 
plugins block of the 
`settings.gradle` file (C:
\Users\USER\Desktop\Alerta
\alerta_mobile\android/set
tings.gradle), by a 
plugin with the id of org.
jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a 
plugins block, your 
project was likely 
created with an older 
template version, in 
which case it is most 
likely defined in the 
top-level build.gradle 
file (C:\Users\USER\Deskto
p\Alerta\alerta_mobile\and
roid/build.gradle) by the 
ext.kotlin_version 
property.
